## Hello there!

> General Kenobi

In case you missed it, I'm Jakub Dajczak, a software developer from Gda≈Ñsk, Poland. And kind of a nerd, as you can see.
I decided to build this website to share my thoughts and projects with others.

So, this is one of my projects - my website.

## How it started

I watched a NetworkChuck video about why I need a website,
and I thought it was a great idea. So, I decided to build one.

<center style="position: relative; padding-top: 56.25%; width: 100%; overflow: hidden;">
 <iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; bottom: 0; right: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
 width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXfFBEuCAr0?si=yyarOI4SQWq_6Auf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center>

BTW I cannot recommend [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck)
enough. He's a great guy. Go watch his videos!

### Why Nuxt?

During one of my university labs, I used [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) to build a website, and honestly,
I fell in love with it. However, I never had the chance to use it again. Later,
I discovered that [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) exists as a Vue framework,
and I decided to give it a try. Since I needed something that would work on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/),
I was delighted to find that Nuxt was perfect for that.

## How it's built

In the beginning I was thinking about building a website from scratch and even started to write some code, but
later I found amazing [template](https://github.com/fayazara/zooper) made by [Fayaz Ahmed](https://github.com/fayazara)
and I decided to use it. I was a blast, and it was a pleasure to work with it. Thanks Fayaz!

As I mentioned before, I'm using GitHub Pages to host my website. I have a separate repository for the website,
and I'm using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to deploy it. It was very easy to set up, and
works as a charm.

## What's next?

I'm hoping to add new articles and describe my learnings in the future. I'm also planning to start and organize
my new projects, so stay tuned!

See You Starside!
